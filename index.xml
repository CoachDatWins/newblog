Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Amazon Berlin.
During my studies, I gained a lot of interest in algorithms and data structures, as well as distributed systems, databases, and search engines. I explored those topics with my master’s thesis on graph compression, and with side projects on LSM tree and search engine implementations.</description></item><item><title>Library</title><link>https://example.org/library/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.org/library/</guid><description>Designing Data-Intensive Applications Excellent book about many distributed systems concepts, databases, and big data processing ideas.
Database Internals Deep dive into database concepts that the first book only touches briefly, like data organization on disk, log-structured databases, and so on. It also covers distributed systems.
Building Microservices Concepts tied to developing independent services rather than huge monoliths. Touches testing, CI/CD, communication styles and so on.
Introduction to information retrieval How search engines work, how they are built and maintained.</description></item></channel></rss>
